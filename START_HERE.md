## 🎯 Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Test the App (Today - 10 minutes)

```bash
npm run dev
```

1. Sign up with test email
2. Navigate through all tabs
3. Try uploading an image
4. See the mock AI results

### Step 2: Add Your AI Models (Tomorrow - 1 hour)

**This is the ONLY major thing you need to do!**

Open `MODEL_PLACEMENT_GUIDE.md` and follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Create directories
mkdir -p assets/models/brain
mkdir -p assets/models/heart
mkdir -p assets/models/eye

# 2. Copy your .tflite models
cp /path/to/your/brain_model.tflite assets/models/brain/brain_cnn_v1.tflite
cp /path/to/your/heart_model.tflite assets/models/heart/heart_cnn_v1.tflite
cp /path/to/your/eye_model.tflite assets/models/eye/eye_cnn_v1.tflite

# 3. Update services/aiModelService.ts
# (Follow guide in MODEL_PLACEMENT_GUIDE.md)
```

### Step 3: Configure Storage (Tomorrow - 30 minutes)

In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Create `medical-scans` bucket
2. Create `documents` bucket
3. Run RLS policies (see `SETUP.md`)

### Step 4: Add Sample Data (Optional - 20 minutes)

Add test clinics in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
INSERT INTO clinics (name, city, country, phone, is_verified)
VALUES ('Test Clinic', 'Lagos', 'Nigeria', '+234-XXX', true);
```

### Step 5: Deploy (Week 2)

Follow `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` for complete deployment guide.

## 🎨 Customization Points

Want to customize? Here's what to change:

### Branding
- **App Name:** `app.json` → `"name": "Your App Name"`
- **Icon:** Replace `assets/images/icon.png`
- **Colors:** Update hex codes in screen files

### Colors
- Primary: `#007AFF` (blue) - Used for buttons, links

- Danger: `#FF3B30` (red) - High risk, errors
- Warning: `#FF9500` (orange) - Medium risk

### Text
- Welcome messages in each screen
- Button labels
- Help text and disclaimers
